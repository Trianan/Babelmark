# BABELMARK:
 # One bookmark to rule them all!

 ## Outline:
     
       This reading-management application will have a command-line interface,
     and will store the data files it uses locally.
     
  ### Purpose:
  
      This program has three core purposes to serve for a user:
     
      - For books they're currently reading:
          - Tracking what page they're on, and their overall progress in the book. 
          - Sorting and viewing their books data according to any variables.
       
      - For books they intend to read:
          - Tracking the order they intend to read them in.
          - Providing a way to easily add or remove books to their backlog.
          - Provide a way to change the priority of any book in their backlog.
          - Sorting and viewing backlog according to any variable.
          - Providing a way to move a book from the backlog to the books in progress.
         
      - For books they have finished:
          - Provide a timestamp for the day they finished a book.
          - Provide a history of finished books.

  ### Dependencies:
  
        The Numpy and Pandas libraries will be used in this program, as the csv files correspond with
      tabular representations of data such as Pandas DataFrames, and both libraries will facilitate
      efficient operations with this kind of data.

 ## To-Do
     
  ### Core features:

      - [✓] Reading and backlog views.
      - [✓] Adding new books to reading-log and backlog.
      - [✓] Restructuring menu system to include submenus for each view.
      - [ ] Removing books from reading-log and backlog.
      - [ ] Editing individual book entries in reading-log and backlog.
      - [✓] Sorting by variables for the reading and backlog views.
      - [ ] Refactoring (is never finished).
     
  ### Planned features:

      - [ ] Statistics view.
      - [ ] Category-tree view.
      - [ ] Loading csv files aside from the default.
      - [ ] Migrate to a compiled language to deal with Python's dependency issues.
      - [ ] Eventually turn into a web app with AI book recommendations???
