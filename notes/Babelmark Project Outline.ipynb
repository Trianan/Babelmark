    " ## Outline:\n",
    "     \n",
    "       This reading-management application will have a command-line interface,\n",
    "     and will store the data files it uses locally.\n",
    "     \n",
    "  ### Purpose:\n",
    "  \n",
    "      This program has three core purposes to serve for a user:\n",
    "     \n",
    "      - For books they're currently reading:\n",
    "          - Tracking what page they're on, and their overall progress in the book. \n",
    "          - Sorting and viewing their books data according to any variables.\n",
    "       \n",
    "      - For books they intend to read:\n",
    "          - Tracking the order they intend to read them in.\n",
    "          - Providing a way to easily add or remove books to their backlog.\n",
    "          - Provide a way to change the priority of any book in their backlog.\n",
    "          - Sorting and viewing backlog according to any variable.\n",
    "          - Providing a way to move a book from the backlog to the books in progress.\n",
    "         \n",
    "      - For books they have finished:\n",
    "          - Provide a timestamp for the day they finished a book.\n",
    "          - Provide a history of finished books.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### Dependencies:\n",
    "  \n",
    "        The CSV library will be used in this program in order to efficiently read and write to the\n",
    "      csv files used to store user data.\n",
    "  \n",
    "        The Numpy and Pandas libraries will be used in this program, as the csv files correspond with\n",
    "      tabular representations of data such as Pandas DataFrames, and both libraries will facilitate\n",
    "      efficient operations with this kind of data.\n"
